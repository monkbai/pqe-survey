abstract="What is needed for good explanation? This paper begins by considering some desiderata for expert system explanation. These desiderata concern not only the form and content of the explanations, but also the impact of explanation generation on the expert system itself--- how it is built and how it performs. In this paper, we use these desiderata as a yardstick for measuring progress in the field. The paper describes two major developments that have differentiated explanation in second generation systems from explanation in first generation systems: 1) new architectures have been developed that capture more of the knowledge that is needed for explanation, and 2) more powerful explanation generators have been developed in which explanation generation is viewed as a problem-solving activity in its own right. These developments have led to significant improvements in explanation facilities: the explanations they offer are richer and more coherent, they are better adapted to the user's needs and knowledge, and the explanation facilities can offer clarifying explanations to correct misunderstandings.",
