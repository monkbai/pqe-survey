\chapter{Visualization for Explainable Classifiers}\label{sec-visualization}

(10-12 pages) Task driven.

\section{Visualization for Model Development}

\subsection{Understanding}

Scientific understanding. Investigate the characteristic of the model.

Existing work:

\subsection{Diagnosing}

Diagnose model and data.

Existing work: 

\subsection{Assessment and Selection}

Unquantifiable assessments, Fairness (e.g., discrimination), Vulnerability

Existing work: 

\section{Visualization for Model Operation}
\subsection{Trust Establishment}
\subsection{Monitoring}

\section{Other Applications}
\subsection{Teaching and Communicating Models}
Narrative, Interactive, etc. to explain your model to others.
\subsection{Learn from the Model} 
Knowledge Discovery; Learn lessons from what the model learned (Alpha Go)

\section{Evaluation}

Review methods and standards of evaluating visualization.

Address the problem of the lack of evaluation standards for visualization for explaianble classifiers.

Proposed?

1. Fidelity. How visualization reflects the real model. (The relativeness and faithfulness of explanation)

2. Understandability. How easy the visualization is to be understood.
