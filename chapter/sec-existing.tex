\chapter{Existing Solutions}\label{sec-existing-solutions}

To improve the accuracy and reliability of software reverse engineering techniques, numerous methods are proposed to tackle the challenges listed in Chapter \ref{sec-challenges}.
Similarly, we follow the pipeline of software reverse engineering to introduce these existing solutions.

\section{Disassembly} \label{sec:existing-disassembly}
As discussed in Chapter \ref{sec-challenges}, one of the major difficulties in disassembly is differentiating code and data. While some successful disassembly tools exist~\cite{hex2014ida,kvroustek2017retdec,ghidra,radare}, these tools inevitably have false positives.
