\chapter{Existing Solutions}\label{sec-existing-solutions}

To improve the accuracy and reliability of software reverse engineering
techniques, numerous methods are proposed to tackle the challenges listed in
Chapter \ref{sec-challenges}.
Similarly, we follow the pipeline of software reverse engineering to introduce
these existing solutions.
