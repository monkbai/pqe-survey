\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}

This survey presents a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art software reverse engineering techniques. We conclude and discuss the main challenges including, symbolization, variables recovery, types recovery, and control flow recovery.
We also present the existing solution for tackling these problems exist in different stages of the reverse engineering pipeline. In the end, we introduce the advanced topics and propose several potential directions to improve the ability of reverse engineering further.

Reverse engineering has been widely used in a variety of security-critical applications and will continue to support security-related tasks. Continued research into more efficient and accurate reverse techniques will benefit the entire security community. We expect this study will help beginning researchers discover more research opportunities and lead reverse engineers to use the latest research output in academia.
