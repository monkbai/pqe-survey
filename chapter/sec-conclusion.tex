Explainability is a critical but often-overlooked property for intelligent systems. In this survey, we reviewed techniques that provide explainability to classifiers, with a special focus on visualization. 

The research in the explainability of classifiers is still a growing discipline. There is no consensus on the definition of explainability in the context of supervised learning. There is few rigorous evaluation methods of the explainability of a classifier or a explanation of a classifier. Early work treats the explainability as the ``simplicity'' of a model, and always focuses on the trade-offs between performance and simplicity.
