Chapter 1 Introduction (2.5 pages)

  1.1 Motivation

  1.2 Challenges and Research Issues

  1.3 Overview

Chapter 2 Explainable Classifiers (7 pages)

  2.1 Classification (1.5 pages)

  2.1.1 Definition 

  Formal definitions of the classification problem, classifiers

  2.1.2 Classifiers

  Introduce popular classification models, including SVM, decision trees, neural nets and *ensemble models.

  2.2 Explanation of Classifiers (5 pages)

  2.2.1  Definitions
    
  A review of how previous work define explanations of classifiers. 

  To summarize, no agreed definition of explanation of classifier exists. Here we give a general definition. Next we give problem specific definitions.

  We separate the problem of explaining classifiers into two sub-tasks: explaining the predictions of classifiers (instance-level); explaining the classifier itself (model-level). Give definitions separately.

  2.2.2  Instance-level Explanation
  
   * Model-aware methods
   * Model-unaware methods
   * Research gaps

  2.2.3  Model-level Explanation
    
   * Explain inner components of the model (model-aware) 
   * Explain the model as a whole (model-unaware)
   * Research gaps

  2.3 Evaluation
    
  Address the problem of evaluation, and how other work evaluates.

Chapter 3 Visualization for Explainable Classifiers (10-12 pages)

  3.1 Visualization for Model Development

   3.1.1  Understanding

   Scientific understanding. Investigate the characteristic of the model. Learn lessons from what the model learned (Alpha Go)
    
   Existing work:

   Problems: Visualization as an one-time tool? Evaluation?

   3.1.2  Diagnosing

   Diagnose model and data. 
    
   Existing work: 

   Problems: Generalize for all models v.s. Specialize to certain kinds of models; Scaling to industrial-level model/datasets.

   3.1.3  Assessment and Selection

   Unquantifiable assessments: Fairness (e.g., discrimination), Vulnerability ...
    
   Existing work:

   Problems: Evaluation.

  3.2 Visualization for Model Operation 

   3.2.1 Trust Establishment

   3.2.2 Monitoring 

  3.3 Evaluation 

   Review methods and standards of evaluating visualization.

   Proposed Evaluation?
    
   1. Fidelity. How visualization reflects the real model. (The relativeness and faithfulness of explanation)
    
   2. Understandability. How easy the visualization is to be understood.

Chapter 4 Conclusion (2 pages)

  Summarize Challenges and Research Opportunities
